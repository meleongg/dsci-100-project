# An Analysis on Distinguishing the Presence or Absence of Heart Disease

## Purpose

For my DSCI 100 project, I chose to investigate the main factors behind heart disease using the R programming language. In my report, I aim to answer the question: "Given values for the age, resting_blood_pressure, cholesterol, ST_depression, and max_heart_rate predictors, what would be the heart disease diagnosis?" using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm on the [Processed Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). 

## What I learned
- how to iterate through multiple cycles of the data analysis process
  - including data wrangling, data visualization, data analysis, etc. 
- how to perform K-Nearest-Neighbor Classification using R
- how to apply a K-Nearest-Neighbor Classification model on a realistic problem and interpreting the results
